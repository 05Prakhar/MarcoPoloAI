# Monitization
Since the platform is now focused on discovery, advertisements will serve as the source of revenue.

If the platform evolves into being able to manage bookings, ways of revenue can be:
- Platform Fee - If a customer makes a booking, a fee will be charged.
- Commission - A small % of commission will be charged to businesses listing their servcies on the platform.
